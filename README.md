VR4ALL: Inclusive Design Through Immersive Virtual Reality

VR4ALL introduces the use of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) technology in the early stages of inclusive product design to foster empathy and understanding among design professionals and students.

By simulating the experiences of individuals with visual and motor impairments, IVR helps users gain deeper insights into the challenges faced by this population group. This innovative approach equips higher education teachers with cutting-edge tools and materials to enhance their teaching methods, while also encouraging the development of more accessible and user-friendly products and environments.

🎯 Goals

    Promote inclusive design through empathy-building experiences

    Provide educational tools for teachers and design students

    Raise public awareness about accessibility challenges

🛠️ The IVR Simulation Asset

As part of the VR4ALL initiative, an IVR experience has been developed using a specialized Unity asset that enables realistic simulation of a wide range of visual and motor impairments. This asset is:

    🔁 Fully compatible with Unity and the XR Toolkit

    🔄 Supports intuitive switching between disabilities using configurable filters

    🎮 Allows first-person perspective experiences of each condition

🧠 Simulated Conditions Include:

    🧯 Parkinson’s Disease: Tremors and slowed movements

    ♿ Wheelchair Use: Restricted mobility simulation

    ✋ Limb Loss: Simulates missing upper limbs

    🔴🟢 Colorblindness: Red-green color vision deficiency

    🔍 Glaucoma: Tunnel vision experience

By enabling students and professionals to virtually embody these impairments, VR4ALL fosters a deeper sense of empathy and a more intuitive understanding of accessibility needs.
